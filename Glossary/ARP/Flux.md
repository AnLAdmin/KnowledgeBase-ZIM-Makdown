= ARP flux on Linux

[Src](https://www.linuxmaker.com/en/linux/arp-flux-on-linux-hosts-with-multiple-network-interfaces.html)

Because of multiple NICs to the same subnet a host answers with both MAC addresses or the wrong one for the same IP address.
It's also possible that the host answers with the wrong MAC for an IP.
