The main [advantage](https://github.com/openvswitch/ovs/blob/main/Documentation/intro/why-ovs.rst) of vSwitch is that it is useful for multi server deployments. It also has some additiona√∂l features like easier network management, more tunnel support (GRE, VXLAN, etc.), Layer 3 forwarding, and integration with software-defined networking (SDN) like [OVN](./OVN.md).
