# ZVOL
Created Sonntag 27 Oktober 2024

Represent a block device (ZVOL). 

Similar to a partition (but on steroids):

* Dynamic Sizing: Zvols can be dynamically resized without needing to delete and recreate them. Traditional partitions often require more complex operations to resize.
* Snapshots and Clones: Zvols inherit ZFS's powerful snapshot and cloning capabilities. You can create snapshots of zvols for data protection and create clones for testing or development, which is not typically available with traditional partitions.
* Performance and Features: Zvols benefit from ZFS features like compression, deduplication, and data integrity checks. Traditional partitions don't offer these advanced features natively.
* Management: Zvols are managed through ZFS commands, which provide a more integrated and flexible approach compared to traditional partition management tools.


-> From the view of Linux it is a block device. You can create a classic Linux partitions in it (Not that it's worth it because it somewhat already is one.).
