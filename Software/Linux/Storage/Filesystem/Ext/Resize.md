First [resize partition](../../Partition/Resize.md).
Than resize ext fs by all free space in the partition:
# resize2fs /dev/<Partition>
Resize 
# resize2fs /dev/<Partition> <Size><Unit>

In LVM
------
First [resize partition](../../Partition/Resize.md). Than [resize LVM PV](../../LVM/Operation/Physical_volume/Resize.md). After that [resize LVM LV](../../LVM/Operation/Logical_Volume/Resize.md).
At the end resize ext fs by all free space in the LV:

# resize2fs  /dev/mapper/vg-root <Size><Unit>
